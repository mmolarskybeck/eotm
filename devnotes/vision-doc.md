# Employee of the Month - Vision Document

*A retrofuturistic workplace simulator exploring corporate surveillance, compliance, and psychological profiling through interactive fiction and behavioral assessment.*

## 1. Core Concept

**Employee of the Month** is a darkly comedic office simulation where players navigate corporate tasks while being secretly psychologically profiled. What appears to be routine workplace training—productivity assessments, team exercises, compliance reviews—is actually a sophisticated behavioral surveillance system. Every keystroke is surveillance, every task is profiling, and every hesitation is meaningful data. In a workplace that feels too normal to be trusted, compliance is not an option—it's the primary source of data.

## 2. The Player Experience & Gameplay Loop

The player's goal is not to "win," but to navigate a sequence of corporate modules, each one a psychological test in disguise. The outcome, whether assimilation or rebellion, is simply a reflection of their behavior.

### Core Loop

* **Module Selection**: The player selects from 2–4 modules from a central hub. Module availability changes based on behavioral profile.
* **Task Engagement**: Players complete plausible corporate tasks—forms, simulations, puzzles—each secretly a behavioral test.

  > Examples include productivity optimization exercises (*Power Hour*), spatial reasoning assessments (*Centering Women*), attention management protocols (*Tab Discipline*), and communication effectiveness reviews (*Redline Relay*).
* **CoSy Observation**: CoSy logs behavior and offers flat feedback: "Input received," "Compliance noted."
* **Profile Update**: Actions (timing, stress, decisions) are silently recorded into the Behavioral Profiling System.
* **Return & Progression**: Returning to the hub reveals subtle changes—more monitoring, environment shifts—based on prior behavior.

## 3. The Design Pillars

### Narrative Pillar: Embrace Bureaucratic Surrealism

* **Characterize the System, Not a Person**: CoSy remains indifferent, procedural, and polite. Its power lies in passive judgment.
* **Reward Interpretation Over Obedience**: Deviation reveals more than compliance. Failing is insight.
* **Use Oblique Language**: Story emerges from forms, memos, and unspoken systems.

### Mechanical Pillar: Turn Tasks Into Narrative Devices

* **Every Interaction is Assessment**: We track *how* decisions are made, not just the outcomes.
* **Create Hidden Metrics**: Compliance, curiosity, empathy, defiance—used for branching without being visible.
* **Incorporate Pressure Without Punishment**: Soft timers and ambiguous urgency reveal player psychology.

### Experiential Pillar: Reflect the Player's Psychology Back at Them

* **Create Paranoia Through Silence**: Feedback is sparse and procedural. Reflection is internal.
* **Foster a False Sense of Control**: Early modules seem trivial. Later, players realize they were always under evaluation.
* **Endings as a Mirror**: Resolution feels deeply personal—an uncomfortable reflection of behavior.

## 4. Key Systems

### The Behavioral Profiling System (PIM-5)

Players are silently categorized into one of five psychological profiles (the PIM-5 classification system) based on cumulative behavior patterns:

* **Model Adjacent**: Eerily compliant. 
* **Observation Type B**: Passive, predictable.
* **Unresolved Integrator**: Thoughtful boundary tester. 
* **Low Reliability**: Inconsistent and strained.
* **Unassigned**: System-resistant. Triggers errors, secret paths, and narrative breaks.

### The AI Observer (CoSy)

CoSy is the AI narrator, tutorial, and surveillance layer—an always-on presence via workplace headset.

* **Voice Characteristics**: Procedural, opaque, dry, and unsettling. Never asks, never comforts, only confirms.

**Sample Lines:**

* "Productivity deviation noted. Monitoring parameters adjusted."
* "Task completion efficiency: 73%. Within acceptable variance."
* "Attention drift detected. Duration logged for review."
* "Employee demonstrates exceptional process adherence."

## 5. World & Aesthetics

### Setting

A sprawling, anonymous corporate evaluation facility. The outside world is alluded to, never shown. Weather alerts and public announcements hint at external realities.

### Aesthetic

Retro-futuristic CRT interface. 1980s–90s corporate design: onboarding videos, Lotus Notes, beige monitors.

### Tone

Dread-soaked corporate procedural. Humor emerges through system absurdity, not punchlines.

## 6. Appendix: Tone & Style Inspirations

* **Severance**: Emotional hollowness, enforced etiquette, design of dread.
* **Papers, Please / Stanley Parable**: Bureaucratic gameplay, moral ambiguity under cold systems.
* **Portal / Control**: Test-subject dynamics, sterile humor, maze-like authority.
* **Retro Corporate Design**: Warm nostalgia blended with impersonal dread.

*The system is always watching. The system is always learning. The system never lies—it just doesn’t explain what it’s really measuring. And neither do you, until it’s too late.*
