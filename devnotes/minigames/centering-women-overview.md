# Centering Women

**Centering Women** is a retrofuturistic puzzle game where players use keyboard controls (WASD or arrow keys) to move four different women—represented by emoji or pixel sprites—across a 7x7 grid. The goal is to “center” them on a designated central square, symbolizing inclusion or visibility within an institutional space.

### 🎮 **Core Mechanics:**

- **Multiple Avatars**: The player can switch between the four women (using Tab/Shift+Tab), each with their own starting position in the grid's corners.
- **Turn-Limited Movement**: The game gives you 30 moves total, regardless of how many women you’re trying to reposition.
- **Obstacles**:
  - **Walls** (🧱) block movement completely.
  - **Boxes** (📦) can be pushed, _but only one at a time_ and only into an empty space—adding a Sokoban-style constraint.
- **Scoring**:
  - Points are awarded based on each woman’s distance from the center:
    - +10 for standing on the center,
    - +7 for one tile away,
    - +4 for two tiles away,
    - 1 for anything farther.
- **Feedback**:
  - A digital score display and "submission evaluation" message reflect how well you did.
  - A glowing pulse effect highlights the currently selected woman.
- **Reset and Submit**: Players can reset the board or submit their score for evaluation, which returns flavor-text commentary on their performance.

_This minigame fits into the broader game as a satirical corporate task—gamifying diversity, equity, and inclusion by turning real systemic challenges into a contained, performative puzzle._

_The tension lies between the flat logic of the system and the impossibility of "perfect" inclusion under arbitrary constraints._
